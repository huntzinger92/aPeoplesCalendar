//structure is as follows:
//eventLibrary is an object where keys are days of the year as MM-DD strings (no zero pad). Values are as follows:
//  each day has 6 categories - Revolution, Rebellion, Birthdays, Assasinations, publications, and other
//      each category has a list of events
//          each event has 7 props, all strings (category redundant, but may help) - category, date, title, description, img, infoSrc, and link



//use this as your actual event library once you get up and running
